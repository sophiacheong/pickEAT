PickEAT is an app (mobile/desktop) where it will help you decide where to eat. This was a project I had during Hackreactor and was given two days to complete. When you input your location (CA based ONLY) and a category of food, it will give you a list of locations to choose from to put onto the wheel. Click the wheel so the app can start picking!
